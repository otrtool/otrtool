otrtool aims to provide an open source tool to deal with otrkey-files from
onlinetvrecoder.com. At the moment it is able to decrypt them, in the
future a download manager and/or EPG could be added.

== DEPENDENCIES ==

* libmcrypt             for blowfish
* libcurl / curl        for the server request

== BUILDING ==

* execute `make`

* Copy the following files to the places they belong:
    ./otrtool           the main binary
    ./otrtool.1.gz      the gzip'ed manpage
    ./LICENSE           the (rights waiver) license

* `make install` will install the binary and the manpage under /usr/local

it in C and without licensing issues.
