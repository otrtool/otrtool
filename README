otrtool aims to provide an open source tool to deal with otrkey-files from
onlinetvrecorder.com. It can decrypt them using keys it fetches from OTR's
servers while authenticating with user-supplied login credentials.

== DEPENDENCIES ==

* libmcrypt             for blowfish
* libcurl / curl        for the server request

== BUILDING ==

* execute `make` (or `gmake` where GNU Make is not the default)

* Copy the following files to the places they belong:
    ./otrtool           the main binary
    ./otrtool.1.gz      the gzip'ed manpage
    ./LICENSE           the (rights waiver) license

* `make install` will install the binary and the manpage under /usr/local.
  Use `make install PREFIX=...` to install elsewhere.

* If you didn't install libmcrypt and libcurl in the usual places,
  specify where the headers and libraries are:
  `CFLAGS="-I/path/to/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/lib" make`

== PORTABILITY ==

* otrtool is developed and tested primarily under GNU/Linux.
  If it turns out not to be portable to your unix-like operating system
  of choice, please file a bug report.

* The Makefile is not portable and relies on GNU Make features.

== REPORTING BUGS ==

For bug reports please do NOT run otrtool with the "-v"-option because it
outputs personal data like your email/password, and/or hashes of them.

== VERSION NUMBERS ==

The version numbers follow the scheme major.minor.bugfixes.
This means that as long as /bugfixes/ increases the software gets more stable.
/Major/ is only incremented on great architectural changes.

== HISTORY ==

In April, 2010, eddy14 reverse-engineered the otrkey-file-format and OTRs
Client-Server-protocol. The blog post describing his work (German):

He also wrote a proof-of-concept tool to decrypt OTRKEYs. PyroPeter rewrote
it in C and without licensing issues.
