* argv[0] could be checked for .../otrdecoder to add -x automatically
  packages could then just link /bin/otrdecoder -> /bin/otrtool
  * Would this be option-compatible to the proprietary otrdecoder?
* config in ~
* twittelevision
* pretty formatting for -i
* Valgrind-cleanliness
* store header information in a struct rather than calling
  queryGetParam() in various places
* in multi-file mode:
  * compact output (one line per file)
  * error handling: continue with next file on non-critical errors
